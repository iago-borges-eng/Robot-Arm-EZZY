# Robot Arm EZZY
 Personal 3d printed robot arm to learn Python, Linux and dynamic simulation on Autodesk Inventor


 Here I will upload all the original STL files, some Solidworks and Inventor files
 Solidworks is important for generating an URDF file for robotic simulation with ROS
 Inventor is used for simulating the physics and the arm movements
