# Robot Arm EZZY
 Personal 3d printed robot arm to learn Python, Linux and dynamic simulation on Autodesk Inventor

This project is a remake of this project below, adding some mechanical designs and simulations.

Here I will upload all the original STL files, some Solidworks and Inventor files
Solidworks has a plug-in that generates URDF files for robotic simulation with ROS.
Inventor is used for simulating the physics and the arm movements.
